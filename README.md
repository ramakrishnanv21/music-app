# Spotify-like React Native Starter (Expo SDK 54 + TypeScript)

This starter includes a global mini-player bar that is visible **only when a track is playing**.

## Quick start
1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn
   ```
2. Start Expo:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
3. Open in Expo Go or run on simulator.

## Notes
- Replace placeholder cover image `assets/cover-placeholder.png` and audio URIs with your own.
- This is a starter template â€” extend with playlists, search, authentication, caching, etc.
